\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a human pose guided pipeline for activity driven weakly supervised object detection task. An attention based module is proposed to model the correlation between person and interacted objects. The attention is used to select dominant human keypoint and also to model the motion correlation. Such attention module is proved effective by superior performance compared with current SOTA methods. We conducted comprehensive experiments to present the performance of object detection and image classification. On both tasks, our method has outperformed baselines by a large margin.
